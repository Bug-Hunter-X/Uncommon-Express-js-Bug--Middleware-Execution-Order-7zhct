# Uncommon Express.js Bug: Middleware Execution Order

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Express.js applications related to middleware function execution order.  Improper placement or errors in earlier middleware can prevent subsequent middleware from executing, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js application.  While functional on its own, it highlights the potential for issues when expanding with additional routes and middleware.

Errors or exceptions in one middleware function can halt the execution chain, preventing later middleware from running.  This can lead to subtle, difficult-to-debug issues.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides an improved version that addresses these issues by handling errors gracefully and ensuring robust middleware execution.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory in your terminal.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  The application will start successfully.
4. (To observe the problem in a complex scenario - not demonstrated in this simple example, consider adding multiple middleware functions and intentionally causing an error in one of them. Observe if subsequent middleware functions are executed.)
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`. The application starts and handles errors more robustly.
